# Car Calculators

A small installable web app (PWA) with three tools for an electric car:

- **Trip** – how many kWh to charge for a trip from home (round trip optional), and the cheapest hours to charge, based on hourly Dutch energy prices.
- **Battery** – how long to charge from the current % to 80% and 100%, when to stop, and what it costs.
- **Petrol vs EV** – cost per km for both cars and the crossover price point.

Settings (home address, cars, default prices) are stored on the device.
